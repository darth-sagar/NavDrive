# 🚗 NavDrive - Autonomous Car Project

NavDrive is a real-time autonomous driving system built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Deep Learning. It captures driving data, trains a CNN to predict steering angles from camera images, and deploys the model for autonomous driving on custom tracks.

## 📁 Project Stages

The project is divided into three main stages:

### 🔹 Stage 1: Data Collection

- Assemble the hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Pi Camera, etc.)
- Manually drive using a CT6B transmitter
- Collect image and sensor data
- Save to `data_runs/`

### 🔹 Stage 2: Model Development

- Transfer data to PC
- Clean and preprocess data
- Train a CNN model to predict steering angle
- Export the trained model as TFLite
- Details in `stage_2_model_training/`

### 🔹 Stage 3: Implementation

- Deploy TFLite model to Raspberry Pi
- Run real-time inference using camera feed
- Send steering prediction to Arduino via Serial
- Arduino drives motors accordingly
- Found in `stage_3_implementation/`
